# GAP Days 2025 – Latin Squares & Group Theory

Welcome to the repository for **"Latin Squares Meet Group Theory: Tools and Insights in GAP"**, a talk presented by **Seyyed Ali Mohammadiyeh** at **GAP Days 2025**.

This talk explores the deep mathematical relationship between **Latin squares** and **group theory**, particularly through the lens of the GAP system and the **LatinSquare GAP package**.
